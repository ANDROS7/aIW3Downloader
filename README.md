==============

As the aIW3 developers have a hard time getting their anti-cheat to run on the client I needed a reliable way to download it. For those interested, it's called "GameRT.dat".

<strong>NTAuthority</strong> for creating the libNP code as aIW3 never changed it.<br>
<strong>LibTom</strong> for the crypto library.
